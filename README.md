# 🦀 My Rust Journey

just plowing through [this](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-00-getting-started.html) and looking up things as I need to.


## 🙋‍♀️ Want to run this locally?
1. Run the installation docs [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html)
2. Clone this repo and `cd` into the main folder
3. From there, run `cargo run`
4. Watch the emojis flood your terminal 🐳


### 🔥 Hot Tip
Make sure to name your `cargo` projects well... or else you'll get repo names like "variables" 🤦‍♀️
